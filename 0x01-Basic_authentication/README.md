# Learning Objectives
## General

* What authentication means
* What Base64 is
* How to encode a string in Base64
* What Basic authentication means
* How to send the Authorization header

# Background Context
In this project, you will learn what the authentication process means and implement a `Basic Authentication` on a simple API.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Basic authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: `Flask-HTTPAuth`). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing. <br>
